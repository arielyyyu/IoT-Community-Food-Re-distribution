# IoT-Community-Food-Re-distribution
Our prompt for this project is to create something that can contribute something to the community of people. We eventually created a food re-distribution system by connecting community food tables to the cloud. We wanted to reduce the avoidable food waste people create every day by re-distributing food within the community. With the help of food, we can bring people in the community together and create their interaction.
